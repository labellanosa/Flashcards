## FLASHCARDS

## Lab 1

### App Description
The flashcard app will help you learn how to study. This app is only at its first stage so we only have one question which is "What is the capital of Norway?" and when you click the flashcard itself, it will reveal the answer. This allows you to study efficiently through repetition.
