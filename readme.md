## FLASHCARDS

üìù `NOTE:` Paste the README templates for each subsequent lab here at the top, (i.e. lab 2, 3, 4). This will show a history of your development process including which users stories you completed and how your app looked and functioned at each step.

## Lab 1

### App Description
`TODO://` The flashcard app will help you learn how to study. This app is only at its first stage so we only have one question which is "What is the capital of Korea?" and when you click the flashcard itself, it will reveal the answer. This allows you to study efficiently through repetition. 

### App Walk-though
`TODO://` Add the URL to your animated app walk-though `gif` in the image tag below. Make sure the gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README. (‚òùÔ∏è Remove this paragraph after after adding gif)
